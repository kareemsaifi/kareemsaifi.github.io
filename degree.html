                        <p>In this module we are taught how to create websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                        We have worked on a <a href="canvas.html">data visualisation canvas</a> with javascript, make sure to check it out if you have the time</p>

                        <p>In this module we learn object oriented programming using the java programming language. We have done various projects that have to do with java from basic projects reaching some object oriented projects</p>

                        <p>This module is all about building intelligent machines, the history of Artificial intelligence and some working with and online simulation of the Miro Bot. In later stages of the module we started learning about how we see things and how to implement this into computer vision</p>

                        <p>With the teaching of basic software engineering concepts to create programs that meet specification, along with working in a team and an introduction to programming using the Ruby programming language and using github for version control this module prepares the students in the Department of computer science to important skills needed for this field</p>

                        <p>The field of computer science relies heavily on mathematical concepts relating to logic, proof, functions and relations and this module provides students with what they need to be able to progress into future computing courses</p>

                        <p>Since I am doing artificial intelligence with Computer Science the field of psychology and specially cognitive psychology is very essential, understanding how our mind works and how we see/feel things, how we come up with decisions and other things.</p>
